# TM Conversation Starter

This repository is part of the [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/) interview process.
We call it a conversation starter because it is not a test or a task you have to do from scratch but a reduced example of what working at Thinkmill might look like.

## How do I get started?

Become familiar with the codebase so we can have a productive discussion about it. Don’t worry about the finer details—we’re not here to catch you out. The goal is simply to establish common ground. This should take approximately 30min.

## Running the project locally

In addition to reading the code and navigating the folder structure you might like to pull the repo and install all the dependencies.
We ship a `yarn.lock` file so please use [yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies.
For more information about Keystone [visit the docs](https://keystonejs.com/).

To run this project use:

```sh
yarn dev
```
